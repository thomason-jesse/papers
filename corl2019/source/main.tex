\title{Vision-and-Dialog Navigation}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

% NOTE: authors will be visible only in the camera-ready (ie, when using the option 'final'). 
% For the initial submission the authors will be anonymized.

% The maximum paper length is 8 pages excluding references and acknowledgements, and 10 pages including references and acknowledgements

\begin{abstract}
Robots navigating in human environments should use language to ask for assistance and be able to understand human responses.
To study this challenge, we introduce \datasetfull{}, a dataset of over 2k embodied, human-human dialogs situated in simulated, photorealistic home environments.
The \nav{} asks questions to their partner, the \ora{}, who has privileged access to the best next steps the \nav{} should take according to a shortest path planner.
To train agents that search an environment for a goal location, we define the \taskfull{} task.
An agent, given a target object and a dialog history between humans cooperating to find that object, must infer navigation actions towards the goal in unexplored environments.
We establish an initial, multi-modal sequence-to-sequence model and demonstrate that looking farther back in the dialog history improves performance.
Sourcecode and a live interface demo can be found at \url{https://cvdn.dev/}

\caption{In \datasetfull{}, two humans are given a hint about an object $t_o$ in the goal room.
The \nav{} moves ($N$) through the simulated environment to find the goal room, and can stop at any time to type a question ($Q$) to the \ora.
The \ora{} has a privileged view of the best next steps ($O$) according to a shortest path planner, and uses that information to answer ($A$) the question.
The dialog continues until the \nav{} stops in the goal room.}
